<h2>To-Do List Application</h2>

<p>I built a simple to-do list using python. You can keep track of your important tasks so you won't forget to do them. You can also remove task and show your task list.</p>
</br>

<h3>Menu</h3>
<p>I added an options menu where you can choose what you want to do in the to-do list.</p>
